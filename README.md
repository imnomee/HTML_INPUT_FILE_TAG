# HTML_INPUT_FILE_TAG

in html everyone knows there is an input file tag

this tag allows you to upload dowcument to the website

what happens if you add capture in the attribute and set that to 'user'?

nothing changed?
well you will see changes on mobile devices.
it will open mobile front camera
capture='environment'
it will open the rear camera

when combined with accept attribute it works better.
if accept='image/_', this will let you take a picture from mobile device
if accept='video/_', this will let you make a video from mobile device.
