To write the documentation for your HTML file, you'll want to cover the following key areas:

1. **Overview**: A brief description of the file and its purpose.
2. **File Structure**: Explanation of the main sections of the code.
3. **Detailed Explanation of Each Element**: What each part of the HTML does.
4. **Usage Instructions**: How to use the form and what to expect.
5. **Notes on Compatibility**: Any known issues or limitations.
6. **Styling**: A mention of the external stylesheet linked in the file.

Here’s a draft for the documentation:

# HTML Documentation: Input File Tag Secrets

## Overview

This HTML file provides a set of input elements designed for capturing or uploading files directly from both PCs and mobile devices. The elements include options for uploading general files, capturing audio, taking photos, and recording videos using either front-facing or rear-facing cameras on mobile devices.

## File Structure

-   **Head Section**:

    -   Defines metadata, viewport settings, and the page title.
    -   Links to an external CSS file for styling.

## Usage Instructions

To use this HTML form:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Select the appropriate input field based on your desired action (upload file, record audio, take a photo, record a video).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to capture or upload your media.

### Notes on Compatibility

-   Not all devices support the `capture` attribute, which might result in some functionalities (like direct camera or microphone access) not working on every device. Users may need to experiment to see which options are supported on their device.

## Styling

The file references an external CSS file (`style.css`) for additional styling. Ensure that this file is present in the same directory as the HTML file to apply custom styles.
